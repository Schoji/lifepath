Alongside language learning, students gain basic knowledge about working life and different professions. The programme combines intensive German as a second language (DaZ) lessons with practical activities and vocational orientation. Students can take part in practical training phases (internships) and learn how school, training and work in Germany function. The BVJ-S is a full-time educational programme and usually lasts one school year, depending on language level.
